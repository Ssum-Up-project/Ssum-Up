as we watch the spike that we've been seeing in commodity prices we have heard a renewal of calls in the united states to drill more that the u.s should be energy independent our rick newman has been looking into that question um and it's it's not sort of as easy as that i think is the is the bottom line right rick there's a lot of confusion about this so i'm doing some reporting to try to bust some of these myths so people think the united states used to be energy independent so here's what that actually means when you combine all forms of energy that we produce in the united states that's oil but also natural gas also coal also renewables such as solar and wind yes we do consume more than we produce which i guess you could say makes us independent but we also participate in global markets which means we export a lot of that we still import energy and in terms of just oil we are not oil independent we have we still uh consume considerably more oil than we produce and we we have not been oil dependent since uh since the early days of uh the oil economy uh which goes all the way back to the 1860s so we have imported more oil than we have um produced for something like the last 45 or 50 years and that's probably going to continue and even though we we do need oil here in the united states a lot of u.s oil actually gets exported to other countries this is a global market um there's no way that the u.s president can put up walls so that all all the oil that's produced in the united states stays in the united states so that means we are susceptible to what happens in global oil markets we cannot fence ourselves off from what's going on in the rest of the world when it comes to oil prices hey rick you are a very much a forward thinker here gas prices record high i paid about over five dollars over the weekend for my premium unleaded that's just what my car takes that's what it recommends uh what do you think those will do or what do you think it means the midterm elections it's a great question and i'm not sure because uh ordinarily when gas prices go this high if they stay that high for any period of time it's just doom for the party that's in control but we saw some polls over the last few days with people americans saying i think more than 60 percent in one poll said it's worth paying more for gas prices as a way of uh tolerating the sanctions that are on russia and doing our part if you will to help out so there is a portion of voters who actually seem to be okay with this for the time being and we've also seen president biden's approval rating which bottomed out around 41 percent has actually ticked up lately so there does seem to be um some support for sort of uh rallying to the cause here i think it's going to be a different story if if gas prices stay this higher go higher for you know for the next eight months leading into the midterm elections because this is real pain for people uh you know who are dependent on cars and sazi i could have told you man um get a car that doesn't require premium fuel i it's serious how about one that just requires less fuel generally maybe get a hybrid or electric right coming around electric i mean i can't be ganged up here it's monday morning it's going to be a long week i think it i think it's time to comment i think it's no comment on wednesday keep it moving we're gonna we're gonna drag you into uh the 21st century whether you like it or not arthric newman thank you so much appreciate it
